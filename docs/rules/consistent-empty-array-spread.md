When spreading a ternary in an array, we can use both `[]` and `''` as fallbacks, but it's better to have consistent types in both branches.

## Fail

```js
const array = [
	a,
	...(foo ? [b, c] : ''),
];
```

```js
const array = [
	a,
	...(foo ? 'bc' : []),
];
```

## Pass

```js
const array = [
	a,
	...(foo ? [b, c] : []),
];
```

```js
const array = [
	a,
	...(foo ? 'bc' : ''),
];
```
