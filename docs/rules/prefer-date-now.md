# Prefer `Date.now()` to get the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch

âœ… *This rule is part of the [recommended](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn#recommended-config) config.*

ðŸ”§ The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

[`Date.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) is shorter and nicer than [`new Date().getTime()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime), and avoids unnecessary instantiation of `Date` objects.

## Fail

```js
const foo = new Date().getTime();
```

```js
const foo = new Date().valueOf();
```

```js
const foo = +new Date;
```

```js
const foo = Number(new Date());
```

```js
const foo = new Date() * 2;
```

## Pass

```js
const foo = Date.now();
```

```js
const foo = Date.now() * 2;
```
