There are [some advantages of using `.textContent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent), like performance and more predictable behavior when updating it.

Note that there are [differences](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent#differences_from_innertext) between them.
