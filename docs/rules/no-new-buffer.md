# Enforce the use of `Buffer.from()` and `Buffer.alloc()` instead of the deprecated `new Buffer()`

âœ… The `"extends": "plugin:unicorn/recommended"` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

ðŸ”§ The `--fix` option on the [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

ðŸ’¡ Some problems reported by this rule are manually fixable by editor [suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions).

Enforces the use of [Buffer.from](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_array) and [Buffer.alloc()](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_alloc_size_fill_encoding) instead of [new Buffer()](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_new_buffer_array), which has been deprecated since Node.js 4.

This rule is partly fixable.

## Fail

```js
const buffer = new Buffer('7468697320697320612074c3a97374', 'hex');
```

```
const buffer = new Buffer([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72]);
```

```js
const buffer = new Buffer(10);
```

## Pass

```js
const buffer = Buffer.from('7468697320697320612074c3a97374', 'hex');
```

```js
const buffer = Buffer.from([0x62, 0x75, 0x66, 0x66, 0x65, 0x72])
```

```js
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(10);
```
