## Fail

```js
import dgram from 'dgram';
```

```js

```

```js
const fs = require('fs/promises');
```

## Pass

```js
import dgram from 'node:dgram';
```

```js
export {strict as default} from 'node:assert';
```

```js
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';
```

```js
const fs = require('fs');
```

```js
import _ from 'lodash';
```

```js
import fs from './fs.js';
```

```js
const fs = require('node:fs/promises');
```
