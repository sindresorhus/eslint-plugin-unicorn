There is no difference in JavaScript between, for example, `1`, `1.0` and `1.`, so prefer the former for consistency.

## Fail

```js
const foo = 1.0;
```

```js
const foo = -1.0;
```

```js
const foo = 123_456.000_000;
```

```js
const foo = 1.;
```

```js
const foo = 123.111000000;
```

```js
const foo = 123.00e20;
```

## Pass

```js
const foo = 1;
```

```js
const foo = -1;
```

```js
const foo = 123456;
```

```js
const foo = 1.1;
```

```js
const foo = -1.1;
```

```js
const foo = 123.456;
```

```js
const foo = 1e3;
```
